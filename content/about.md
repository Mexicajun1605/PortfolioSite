Hola, Γεια σου, Merhaba, 안녕, Bonjour, Wie gehts, Tudo bem, et Salve,

My name is Sam and I am a lifelong learner. I am a linguist, instructor, and an analyst/researcher. Professionally my passions include researching linguistics, teaching languages, with experience in ESL, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, analyzing data to find patterns and insights to learn and teach new things, qualitative research, and I also do some Web development and Data analysis as well.

The languages that I speak in order of proficiency are English, Native, Spanish, in which I have an M.A, French, with teaching experience, Portuguese, also with teaching experience, Greek, both modern and ancient, Latin, German, and I know pieces or facts of other languages such as Persian, Turkish, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Yucatec Mayan, and Sanskrit. The current language I am heavily studying is Greek. 

I am currently looking for work in humanitarian efforts, such as with refugees, or education, or both while I adjunct as a Spanish and Portuguese instructor at New Mexico state and as an ESL Instructor for Lutheran Family Services in Las Cruces, NM.

Outside of the realms of study and work, I like to spend my time hiking, making and maintaining terrariums, photography, playing video games, usually in another language, and spending time with my wife and cat.
