Hola, Bonjour, Wie gehts, Tudo bem, Sawat di krap, Dia duit, et Salve,

My name is Sam and I am a lifelong learner. As a linguist, instructor, and analyst/researcher. Professionally my passions include researching linguistics, teaching languages, with experience in French and Spanish, and analyzing data to find patterns and insights to learn and teach new things.

Some of the tools that I am passionate about are the R and Python programming languages. Some examples of my work in these languages can be found on this site. I hope that you enjoy them.

Some of my goals are to improve my abilities in Statistics, Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and of course learning more languages. I tend to learn by doing so keep up with the blog to see more projects.

The languages that I speak in order of proficiency are English, Native, Spanish, in which I have an M.A, French, with teaching experience, Portuguese, Latin, German, and I know pieces or facts of other languages such as Persian, Korean, Japanese, Greek, Russian, Yucatec Mayan, and Sanskrit

Outside of the realms of study and work, I like to spend my time hiking, making and maintaining terrariums, photography, playing video games, usually in another language, and spending time with my wife and cat.
